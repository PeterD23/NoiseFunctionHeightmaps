# NoiseFunctionHeightmaps

Honours project in Java. Utilises the OpenSimplex noise library to generate detailed heightmaps with a custom RGB algorithm.
This in turn generates detailed maps that can be used for games.

How to use:

Import the project into an IDE such as Eclipse or IntelliJ.
Run from src/Initialisation/Main.java.

Features:

Can use a radial map to generate central looking islands
32-bit seeds
Saves each individual layer, so land and sea create separate images. Transparency is added so the images can be merged
in an image editing program.
